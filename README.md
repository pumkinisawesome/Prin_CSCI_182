## Class Description:
In-depth coverage of programming concepts, with emphasis on data structures, including arrays, structs, class objects, stacks, queues, and lists. Algorithms and complexity analysis for searching and maintaining sorted and unsorted lists. Explicit pointer data type and dynamic allocation of memory. Introduction to object-oriented programming and recursive functions. 

## Technologies
The following technologies were used in this class:
- C++
- Linked lists, stacks, queues
- Binary trees
- Sequential search, binary search
- Binary search trees, balanced binary search trees, hash tables
- Heaps for priority queues
- Sorting algorithms
- Analysis of time and space requirements

## Projects
[//]: # (I looked up a way to write comments that don't render in the HTML output, and this was the best way according to the internet, so I used them to keep the template here)

[//]: # (- A list of projects found within this repository, followed by a link to each, and description. For example:)

- Sample Project: https://github.com/pumkinisawesome/Prin_CSCI_182/tree/main/SampleProject.
  Used Node.js to build a Sample Project. Learned how to handle dynamic arrays of objects.
- Mod Program: https://github.com/pumkinisawesome/Prin_CSCI_182/tree/main/ModProgram. 
  Used C++ to build a program that finds the mod of two numbers using two different methods, and prints them to console.
