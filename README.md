# CSCI 182 - Introduction to Data Structures
Jamie Bland

Principia College - Spring 2022
---
## Class Description:
In-depth coverage of programming concepts, with emphasis on data structures, including arrays, structs, class objects, stacks, queues, and lists. Algorithms and complexity analysis for searching and maintaining sorted and unsorted lists. Explicit pointer data type and dynamic allocation of memory. Introduction to object-oriented programming and recursive functions. 

## Technologies
The following technologies were used in this class:
- C++
- Linked lists, stacks, queues
- Binary trees
- Sequential search, binary search
- Binary search trees, balanced binary search trees, hash tables
- Heaps for priority queues
- Sorting algorithms
- Analysis of time and space requirements

## Projects
[//]: # (I looked up a way to write comments that don't render in the HTML output, and this was the best way according to the internet, so I used them to keep the template here)

[//]: # (- A list of projects found within this repository, followed by a link to each, and description. For example:)

- Mod Program: https://github.com/pumkinisawesome/Prin_CSCI_182/tree/main/ModProgram. 
  Used C++ to build a program that finds the mod of two numbers using two different methods, and prints them to console. 
  Learned some basics of C++. 

- Employee Printout: https://github.com/pumkinisawesome/Prin_CSCI_182/tree/main/EmployeePrintout. 
  Used C++ to build a program to store data about an employee within a structure. 
  Learned how to create custom data types, such as structs and enums, and how they can be nested.

- Boat Arrays: https://github.com/pumkinisawesome/Prin_CSCI_182/tree/main/BoatArrays. 
  Used C++ to build a program which reads data from a file, and prints out the name and year of boats. 
  Learned how to read from files, use 1d arrays, and use loops to apply operations to arrays. 

- Drunken Sailor: https://github.com/pumkinisawesome/Prin_CSCI_182/tree/main/DrunkenSailor. 
  Used C++ to build a program which uses random numbers to move a "sailor" around a 2d array. 
  Learned how to use 2d arrays and random numbers.
